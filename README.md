- 👋 Hi, I’m Hero, aka Alex Humphries
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, what else? I like all kinds, mainly for use in making games. I always have found it fascinating.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python! A strange and flexible language. But what can it really do?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video games! Or any kind of project if you like what I do.
- 📫 How to reach me email, discord, or any of my social medias.
